# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Platform Cooperative Development Kit! We welcome contributions in the form of code and documentation improvements.

## Code Contributions

If you're contributing code, please create a branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on from the project's `dev` branch. Open a pull request, clearly describing the work you've done, including steps for us to test it. Please ensure that you follow the coding standards (CSS, JavaScript, and PHP) for the project to which you are contributing. Each project includes scripts (NPM and Composer) for code linting and, in some cases, unit testing. Please consult the documentation for the project to which you are contributing to determine the appropriate tests to run against your code before submitting your pull request.
